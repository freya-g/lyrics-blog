# Lyrics Blog

A lyrics website running on Node.js.

I created this website both as programming practice for learning Node.js and web development, and also to share my translations of Japanese songs I enjoy.

Website and translations are still being worked on.

Possible future features/improvements:

* Search by title or artist
* Tags
* UI improvements
* More lyrics functionality
	* Furigana/Hiragana reading over Kanji
	* Toggle Romaji
	* Align lyrics with translated line
